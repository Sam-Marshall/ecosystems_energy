“How much does the environmental policy of a country impact on its CO2 production, pollution or biodiversity?”

1. We found that strict enforcement of environmental policies does indeed correlate with a decrease in mean population exposure to PM2.5 in all countries tested, as well as a decrease in CO2 emissions.
2. Interestingly, the consequences of an increased budget allocated to environmental causes did not generally correlate with biodiversity or pollution numbers.  This might be linked to the fact that an investment in R&D for example will only have a potential impact years after the investment. 
3. Biodiversity data are harder to correlate to the governmental policies due to the fact that the impact of new laws are likely only going to be be seen years/decades later. 
4. Biodiversity increases seen in some of the countries we analyzed could be more due to technological improvements to data collection methods (GPS, satellites imaging, etc) than to an actual growth of the population or improvement in biodiversity.
5. Pollution rates and environmental regulations/policies are only a few aspects of the complex web of what ultimately impacts biodiversity on a global scale.
6. All of the data we analyzed had to be reported by the countries themselves to some extent which could introduce biases that confound analyses (varying technologies/approaches used for measurements, etc)
